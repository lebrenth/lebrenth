- 👋 Hi, I’m @lebrenth
- 👀 I’m interested in location based games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin for Android mobile
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything yet, but maybe if my latest project goes well I may need more networking capabilities.
- 📫 How to reach me? Twitter @LRStrasburg is probably a good starting point.
